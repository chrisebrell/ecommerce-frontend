# Inspiration:
    What inspired us to choose building an e-commerce application was how big online shopping is in today's day and age. Being able to search for, view, and purchase virtually anything you want from the convenience of your phone or computer screen is why it has become more and more popular through the 21st century. 

# How to use:
    When you hit the Simply Shopping homepage, you are met by several categories that you can shop under. At the top of the site you'll find the navigation bar that includes your cart, a search bar, sign in forms for both users and admins who wish to sell their own products on our site, and a shop button that displays all products on our site. When you display a product's description, you have the option to add it to your cart. From your cart, you are able to complete your purchase once you input your payment information and have created an account.
