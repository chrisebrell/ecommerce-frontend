# Inspiration:

    What inspired us to choose building an e-commerce application was how big online shopping is in today's day and age. Being able to search for, view, and purchase virtually anything you want from the convenience of your phone or computer screen is why it has become more and more popular through the 21st century.

# How to use:

    When you hit the Simply Shopping homepage, you are met by several categories that you can shop under. At the top of the site you'll find the navigation bar that includes your cart, a search bar, sign in forms for both users and admins who wish to sell their own products on our site, and a shop button that displays all products on our site. When you display a product's description, you have the option to add it to your cart. From your cart, you are able to complete your purchase once you input your payment information and have created an account.

# Technologies used:

    MongoDB: Database
    NextJS: Backend framework
    Axios: Data handling
    Tailwind: Code effeciency
    Cors: API handling
    ReactJS: Frontend framework
    AWS(or Vercel): Application deployment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
